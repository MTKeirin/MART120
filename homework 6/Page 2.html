        <h2>Short Story</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Okinawa!</h3>

        <p>I've never lived so close to the ocean. The breeze, sun, and sounds are delightful.</p>
        
        <p>It's a little weird to walk around and say things like:</p>
        
        <p>My ancestors could've walked here or I wonder if we watched the sunsets the same</p>
        
        <p>I've never felt like that before. The difference between meeting and loving the generation directly above you</p>
        
        <p>and thinking that 200 years ago someone who sorta looks like me was here is crazy.</p>
        
        <p>It makes me feel more connected to history. Maybe this is what all of those family tree projects</p>
        
        <p>were supposed to evoke.</p>
